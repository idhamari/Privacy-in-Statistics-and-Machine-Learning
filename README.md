# Privacy-in-Statistics-and-Machine-Learning

This is a practical tutorial based on Adam Smith [Privacy in Statistics and Machine Learning
Course](https://dpcourse.github.io/schedule.html).

I will try to explain the math using examples and python code. This will help beginners to get better understanding! The original course includes video lectures and slides so I suggest you start there and then practice here. Each topic will have its own colab notebook. All notebooks will be available publicly in github. You can use the [github discussion] section to ask questions and hopfully getting answers.

Notes: 

- I will use photos and resources from these lectures and other resources, all source links will be available.
- This is still work on progress. I will try to add more contents whenever I have more free time 
- Contribution is welcome!
- If you have questions, comments, corrections, or feedback, please post in the [dicussion forum](https://github.com/idhamari/Privacy-in-Statistics-and-Machine-Learning/discussions/categories/q-a).
